# Regards iOS — accessibility rules

The app must be fully usable by someone who relies on VoiceOver, larger text,
reduced motion, or high-contrast modes. This is a **merge-blocking** concern,
not a polish-phase one.

Keep this file up to date — every new screen gets a line in the *screens
audited* table at the bottom.

## Standing rules (every PR)

1. **Automated audit.** `XCUIApplication.performAccessibilityAudit()` runs in
   `RegardsAccessibilityTests` on every build. It catches missing labels,
   contrast failures, too-small touch targets (<44×44pt), elements trapped from
   VoiceOver focus, duplicate traits, and dynamic-type clipping. A failing
   audit blocks merge.
2. **VoiceOver label completeness.** Every interactive element has an
   `.accessibilityLabel`. Decorative glyphs (channel icons inside labeled rows)
   are `.accessibilityHidden(true)` so they don't pollute the rotor. Compound
   rows collapse into **one** accessibility element with a natural-language
   label and a meaningful hint.
3. **Dynamic Type through `accessibility5`.** System fonts scale automatically;
   custom sizes use `@ScaledMetric`. Layouts use `ViewThatFits` or stacked
   variants at the largest sizes so text never clips or truncates mid-word.
4. **Color contrast verified in code.** `ColorContrastTests` (lands in PR2)
   asserts every foreground/background pair the design system exposes meets
   WCAG AA (≥4.5:1 for body text, ≥3:1 for large text and icons). Palette
   tweaks that drop a pair below threshold fail CI before they ever land in a
   screen.
5. **Reduce Motion honored.** All transitions respect
   `@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion)`. No parallax, no spring bounces,
   no auto-advancing carousels.
6. **High-contrast + Differentiate Without Color tested.** Snapshot tests
   (PR3) cover `colorSchemeContrast = .increased` and
   `accessibilityDifferentiateWithoutColor = true`. Information conveyed by
   color (e.g., priority tiers) has a non-color indicator too.
7. **Touch targets ≥ 44×44pt.** Enforced by the audit plus a design-system
   `MinTapArea` modifier on anything interactive.
8. **Keyboard / Switch Control / Voice Control.** Focus order follows reading
   order; use `.accessibilitySortPriority` only when the default is wrong.
   Every tappable view responds to the default accessibility action.
9. **VoiceOver manual smoke before merge.** See
   [`accessibility-smoke.md`](accessibility-smoke.md) — work through the
   script on a simulator (or real device) before merging any PR that changes
   UI. Note the result in the PR description.
10. **Documentation.** Every new screen gets a row in the table below.

## Contrast-pair registry

PR1 ships the color assets only (Background, Ink, Muted, AccentColor,
LaunchBackground). Ratios computed from the sRGB values in
`Regards/Resources/Assets.xcassets/*.colorset/Contents.json`.

| Foreground | Background | Ratio (light) | Ratio (dark) | Required | OK |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ink | Background | ~13.5:1 | ~15.2:1 | 4.5:1 | ✅ |
| Muted | Background | ~5.6:1 | ~5.8:1 | 4.5:1 | ✅ |
| White | AccentColor | ~3.4:1 | ~3.1:1 | 3:1 (large/icon) | ✅ |

PR2 adds `ColorContrastTests` so these ratios are asserted automatically; the
table becomes the human-readable mirror of the test data.

**PR1 validation.** The initial Muted value derived from the JSX mock
(`oklch(0.52 …)`) computed to ~3.9:1 vs Background in sRGB. The launch-screen
accessibility audit caught this on first run and the value was darkened to
`#6B6359` (light) to pass ≥4.5:1. Keep the next palette edit honest —
`performAccessibilityAudit()` will catch regressions, but the contrast-pair
test in PR2 will catch them *before* they ship.

## Screens audited

| Screen | PR | Date | Commit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Launch / root placeholder | PR1 | TBD | TBD | One-view smoke — the full eight-screen audit lands in PR3. |
