# Regards — iOS

Native iOS app built against ARCHITECTURE.md §6 (Swift 6 / SwiftUI / GRDB,
iOS 17+). Source of truth for the Xcode project is [`project.yml`](project.yml);
the `Regards.xcodeproj` is regenerated from it.

## One-time setup

```bash
brew install xcodegen
```

You need Xcode 16 or newer. Swift 6 strict concurrency is on by default.

## Regenerate the Xcode project

Any time `project.yml` changes:

```bash
cd ios
xcodegen generate
```

Commit both `project.yml` and the regenerated `Regards.xcodeproj/`.

CI runs `xcodegen generate && git diff --exit-code` on every push — if the
committed xcodeproj drifts from `project.yml`, the build fails.

## Build + test

```bash
cd ios
xcodebuild \
  -project Regards.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Regards \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' \
  build

xcodebuild \
  -project Regards.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Regards \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' \
  test
```

The `test` action runs:

- **`RegardsTests`** — `swift-testing` unit suite. Domain-layer tests land here
  in PR2 (§13: Domain layer at 100% coverage).
- **`RegardsAccessibilityTests`** — XCUITest suite that launches the app and
  calls `XCUIApplication.performAccessibilityAudit()`. A failing audit blocks
  merge. See [`docs/accessibility.md`](docs/accessibility.md) for the standing
  rules.

`RegardsUITests` is a separate target for general UI automation and is not
wired into the default test plan yet.

## Phase plan

This app ships in three phases per ARCHITECTURE.md §14. PR1 (this scaffold)
gets the project to green. PR2 lands domain + data. PR3 lands the eight-screen
SwiftUI shell.
